## A NodeJS app made using the HowLongToBeat API

This backend NodeJS App using ExpressJS, and interconnected with HowLongToBeat API by Christian Katzorke. It's meant to be a REST-ish(GET Request Only) API made for in conjunction with the Busy Gamer App.

### What's the Busy Gamer App

The Busy Gamer App, allows you to track the videogames that you want to play, and it helps you to calculate approximately how long itâ€™s going to take you to finish all those games. (not everyone can play more than 2 hours a day :c )

- **The Busy Gamer App is almost done, so in the meantime the link to it will be empty, until it gets published**

## Installation

To use this NodeJS App you should first install it by following the next step-by-step instructions in your terminal.

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EmilioBlacksmith/TheBusyGamerAppAPI.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd TheBusyGamerAppAPI

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

## Usage

In order to run this NodeJS app, run the next command in your terminal.

```bash
# Run the app
npm start
```

Once you run it it will receive the next message from the CLI:

```bash
// Server is running on: 4000
// CTRL + C to close server...
```

Now you can now use the API with the **localhost:4000** endpoint.

### How to make a search request?

Once you have the app running, you can call the next endpoint to make a search request with a query.

```bash
localhost:4000/search?q=[insert-your-search-query-here]
```

Inside your web app it's recommended to encode your query with encodeURIComponent() in order to not get any artifacts when searching.

### How to make a request of the TOP 25 games right now?

Once you have the app running, you can call the next endpoint to make a request of the top 25 games currently being played the most by the How Long To Beat Users.

```bash
localhost:4000/topGames
```

### What If I want to make a manual update of the TOP 25 games?

In the case you want to do a manual update of the topGames.json, you can call the next.

```bash
localhost:4000/manual-update
```

!! take into account that it takes around 5 to 8 seconds approximately to fully make an update of the latest top 25 games, due to it being a web scrapping code that I did for this app's purpose.

## Example Request

The next is an example of a search request using REACT for demonstrations purposes.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// URL where we do the GET Request
const searchURL = "http://localhost:4000/search?q=";

export default function SearchFunction() {
    // This UseState is where we store the searched games
	const [dataSearched, setDataSearched] = useState([]);

    // This UseEffect is the initial action for searching the solicited game
    React.useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                // In this example I will search the Yakuza Games
                const valueSearched = encodeURIComponent("Yakuza");
                let search = searchURL + valueSearched;
                const response = await fetch(search);

                // Check if there was any error
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
                }

                //Get the JSON file from the API
                const jsonData = await response.json();

                //handle error if needed, or just change the data with the json received from the API
                if (jsonData.error && jsonData.error === "Search query not found") {
                    setDataSearched([]);
                } else {
                    setDataSearched(jsonData);
                }
            }catch(error)
            {
                console.error("Error fetching data:", error.message);
            }
        }
	}, []);

    // Display the games found in the search request in a ordered list.
    return(
        <div>
            <ol>
                {dataSearched.map((item) => {
                    <li key={item.id}>{item.name} || {item.imageURL} || It takes {item.gameplayMain} Hours to finish it, if you focus on Main Story only.</li>
                })}
            <ol>
        </div>
    );
}
```
